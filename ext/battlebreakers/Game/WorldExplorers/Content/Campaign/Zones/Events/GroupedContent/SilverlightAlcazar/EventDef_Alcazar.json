Though initially discovered centuries ago - the gates have lied dormant for years. However, soon after the first techo-magic crystal was uncovered they became active. Scientists and Magi have travelled across the land in order to study the gates for themselves. Though research is still far to new to reach any conclusions, the gates appear to be gateways to other worlds… Before the legion, in the time of peace, the Silverlight Alcazar was constructed as a proper housing for the Gates. Additionally, a new faction of noble and trusted warriors was established to protect the Alcazar, The Silverlight Guardians. Their dominion has been short lived, but until now the Silverlight Guardians have ensured fair and neutral access to the gates while keeping them safe. The Legion have identified the Gates as a potential weapon and sent a sizable force to wrest control from the Guardians. Help them restore order before they’re completely overwhelmed!
